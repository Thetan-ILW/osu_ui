# osu! UI for soundsphere
This is a UI theme for [soundsphere](https://soundsphere.xyz/), created for people who like osu! UI, but want the features of soundsphere.   
Layout is 1:1 to the original osu!. Animations are also very similar.  
Skinning is fully supported and you can customize everything! See screenshots below.  
# Installing
- Open `soundsphere`.
- Navigate to `options -> themes`.
- Press download near the `osu!` line.
- Wait for it to download, then restart the game.
- Select `osu!` in the same tab using `UI theme` dropdown.
# Assets
This repository does not contain any assets created by peppy, the creator of `osu!`.  
You can do whatever you want with my assets, I don't care. I don't own the files listed in osu_ui/assets/CREDITS.txt, you should credit those authors if you use assets from this repository.
